PROMPT FOR UPGRADE THIS TO NEXT LEVEL 
🔹 PROJECT CONTEXT

You are working on an end-to-end stock price prediction and analysis web application.

Current Stack:

Python

TensorFlow (LSTM)

yfinance

scikit-learn

Streamlit (frontend)

Saved model (lstm_stock_model.h5)

Saved scaler (scaler.pkl)

The app currently:

Predicts next-day closing price using an LSTM model

Displays line charts

Uses only the Close price as input

Has no trading signals, indicators, or real market charts

🔹 OBJECTIVE

Upgrade this project into a real-world stock market–style AI decision support system, similar to TradingView/Yahoo Finance (for learning purposes only).

This includes:

Professional candlestick charts

Technical indicators

AI-assisted Buy / Sell / Hold signals

Explainable recommendations

Backend logic improvements

Frontend UI/UX upgrades

Model evaluation & comparison

⚠️ This project must remain educational, not financial advice.

🔹 BACKEND TASKS (MANDATORY)
1️⃣ Data Engineering

Fetch Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV) data using yfinance

Ensure proper handling of missing data

Allow dynamic stock symbols

2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Add the following indicators:

Simple Moving Average (20, 50)

Exponential Moving Average

RSI (14)

MACD

Volume Moving Average

These indicators must be:

Computed dynamically

Stored in a DataFrame

Reusable by frontend & model logic

3️⃣ AI Model Improvements

Keep existing LSTM model

Add optional support for:

Multi-feature input (OHLC + indicators)

Multi-day forecasting (optional but recommended)

Add evaluation metrics:

RMSE

MAE

Directional accuracy

Log results clearly.

4️⃣ Buy / Sell / Hold Signal Logic

Implement rule-based signals (not blind AI output):

BUY Signal:

RSI < 30

Price above 50-day MA

LSTM predicts upward movement

SELL Signal:

RSI > 70

Price below 50-day MA

LSTM predicts downward movement

HOLD:

Conflicting or weak signals

Each signal must return:

Signal type (BUY / SELL / HOLD)

Confidence level (Low / Medium / High)

Explanation (human-readable)

5️⃣ Explainability Layer

For each recommendation:

Explain why the signal was generated

List indicator values

Show model trend direction

No black-box outputs.

🔹 FRONTEND TASKS (MANDATORY)
6️⃣ Real-World Stock Charts

Replace line charts with:

Candlestick charts (red/green candles)

Display:

OHLC data

Volume bars

Moving averages overlay

Use professional visualization libraries:

plotly

mplfinance

7️⃣ UI / UX Improvements

TradingView-like layout:

Left → chart

Right → indicators + signals

Highlight:

Current trend

Buy/Sell/Hold badge

Color-coded signals:

🟢 Buy

🔴 Sell

🟡 Hold

8️⃣ Prediction Visualization

Show:

Historical prices

Predicted next price

Optional multi-day forecast

Plot actual vs predicted values

9️⃣ Risk & Safety

Add clear disclaimer:

“This tool is for educational purposes only and not financial advice.”

Do not auto-execute trades.

🔹 QUALITY & ENGINEERING STANDARDS

Modular code structure

Clean separation:

data/

indicators/

model/

signals/

ui/

Add docstrings & comments

Avoid hard-coded values

Handle edge cases gracefully

Optimize for readability and maintainability

🔹 FINAL DELIVERABLES

The final system must:

Look like a real stock market dashboard

Provide interpretable AI-assisted insights

Be suitable for:

College evaluation

GitHub portfolio

LinkedIn showcase

Clearly demonstrate:

ML knowledge

Time-series understanding

UI/UX thinking

Ethical AI usage

🔹 IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT claim guaranteed profits

Do NOT create an autonomous trading bot

Focus on decision support, not financial advice

🔹 SUCCESS CRITERIA

If completed correctly, this project should be:

More advanced than typical student projects

Comparable to beginner–intermediate industry dashboards

Easily explainable to professors and recruiters
